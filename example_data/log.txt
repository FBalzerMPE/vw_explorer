The following log file shows how part of our log file looked like during observations.
When writing your own, the following things are important:
- Denote the date before the rows corresponding to it; if the UT noted advances to the next day, put the date string before it.
- In case all fits files are available, this is not as important as the program will read [date, time, target, dither, exptime, focus, airmass] from the header and replace values.
- Make sure you don't put any spaces within entries (e.g., fiducial coordinates should be [XXX.x,YYY.y] and not [XXX.x, YYY.y], and targets should contain underscores or hyphens before the dither indicator, and not whitespaces).
- You may use both tabs and spaces as delimiters.
- Only lines starting with 'vw' will be parsed as a line describing an observation.
- During parsing, pay attention to the log messages as those will tell you what went wrong.
- Any additional lines (other than 'vw' and '# date:') will be ignored.
- It doesn't matter whether you omit the '-' for comments, but make sure to put them for all other columns.
